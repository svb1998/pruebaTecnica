## Frontend Technical Challenge (Live – 1 Hour)

Hey,<br>
This challenge is just a way for us to see how you think, code, and tackle a real-world frontend task. We’re not expecting a complete or perfect solution — what matters is how you reason through problems, structure your code, and work with common frontend patterns.

---

## What you'll build

You’ll work on **two tasks**, both focused on practical frontend skills:

---

### Part 1: Implement a Table Layout

Recreate the layout based on the following Figma design:
[Figma Design – FE TEST](https://www.figma.com/design/P1iJ4xcsQZ5ouhXXVW76vB/FE-TEST?node-id=6-1224&t=bRkzp6R60TKscF7v-1)

Using React + TypeScript and CSS (or any framework you prefer), build a UI that includes:

* A page title/header
* A search input (not functional — UI only)
* An **"Add new"** button (not functional — UI only)
* A **table** with:
  * Static data (hardcoded or mocked)
  * **Header row** with **Name**, **Date added** and **Actions** columns
    * **Edit** and **Delete** actions (not functional — UI only)
  * Body: **10 rows** of data
* Allow switching between **10, 15, or 20 rows**
* Add **functional pagination**

Feel free to organize your layout however you like. We’re looking at how you structure components, apply layout techniques, and style things cleanly.

---

### Part 2: Simple Chat UI with Fake API

Build a basic chat interface where:

* The user can type a message and click "Send"
* Simulate an API call (use `setTimeout` or a Promise with 1s delay)
* The response should be an **echo** of the message
* Display the full chat history in the UI

**Bonus**: Store the chat history in `localStorage` so it persists on refresh.

**Note**: The UI should be simple — no need to make it beautiful or pixel-perfect. <br> We care more about how you structure and manage the logic than visuals.

---

## How to approach it

* Chill and code how you normally do
* You don’t have to finish everything
* How far you get does **not** affect your evaluation directly
* Complex does **not** mean better — we value clarity and structure
* You can use any **CSS framework or styling approach** you like
* You’re free to search the internet, but please **don’t use ChatGPT or any AI tools** during the test
